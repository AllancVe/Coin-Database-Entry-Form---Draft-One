1. Start application
2. Click 'Home' Tab on bottom left
3. Click 'Launch Form'
4. This should launch the form? 

Errors:

When on Step 3. Microsoft Visual Basic will display the following error:
Run-time error'13':
Type mismatch


Trouble Shooting:

For some reason unbenonst to me, the Step 3 error keeps occuring.
I have tried several fixed, yet I cannot seem to find one.

I have a feeling I clearly mislabeled something in the code, so I will one day come back to this when I have more experience.
That or someone else shows me where I am going wrong?
